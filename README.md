# Spam-Email-Detector
This is the 410 Final Project for Team 51
</br> 
For Milestone, we are doing three models to detect spam emails: Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. Our goal is to find the model with the highest accuracy. We are training the model with https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackksoncsie/spam-email-dataset and testing the result with https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/venky73/spam-mails-dataset.
